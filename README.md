 * The password is very important for our personal information protection.
 * This repo is about checking of password's strength to protect our information from Cyber theives.
 * There are many types of password attacks e.g., Bruteforce attack, Dictionary attack, Credential stuffing, Man-in-the-middle, Password spraying and Keylogging.
 * We want to prevent the information by creating strong passwords.
 * The passwords must includes mixing of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters and should be in random letters with 8 or 12+ characters because random letters and length of the passwords cannot be find easily, it is complex to find.
 * I had used a website passwordmeter.com to check the password's strength and uploaded a screenshot of sample password.
 * Some tools can perform those password attacking e.g., Hydra, Hashcat, John The Ripper, etc,.
 * Those tools will check the password by the victims given information and generate some passwords.
